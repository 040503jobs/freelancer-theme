Freelancer theme
=========================

Jekyll theme based on [Freelancer bootstrap theme ](http://startbootstrap.com/templates/freelancer/)

After [downloading](https://github.com/jeromelachaud/freelancer-theme/archive/master.zip), use the normal process of serving a jekyll site. Navigate to the directory in terminal and type `jekyll build` followed by `jekyll serve`

## How to use
1. Place a image in `/img/portoflio/`
2. Create posts to display your projects. Use the follow as an example:
```txt
---
layout: default
modal-id: 1
date: 2014-07-18
img: cabin.png
alt: image-alt
project-date: July 2014
client: The Client
category: Web Development
description: The description of the project

---
```
3. And finally, serve Jekyll source as you would normally.
